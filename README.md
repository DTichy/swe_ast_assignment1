Solution for Assignment 1 - Advanced Software Testing

As is well known, a day on Mars does not have 24 hours. Therefore, it has been decided in the project to divide a Mars day into 25 Mars-hours, each further subdivided into 100 Mars-minutes.
Mars has two moons: Deimos and Phobos.
For a certain experiment on Mars, you need both Mars-moons to be visible at the same time for as long as possible. It is therefore necessary to have a software function Moon that takes two Mars-intervals (one for Deimos, one for Phobos) as input and counts the number of Mars-minutes they overlap.

If the two intervals have only one point in common then the result is not zero minutes, but one minute.
